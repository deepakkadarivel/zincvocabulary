##Problem Statement

Implement a 2-step wizard to create a set of frequently occurring words from the provided passage.

In Step 1, the user should be able to paste a large piece of text in the text box. When the user clicks "Next", find the 10 most frequently occurring words from the passage and show them in Step 2. 

In Step 2, The user should be able to  delete words using the "x" symbol. The user should also be able to add their word of choice to this list by using the text box at the bottom of the list. The user should be able to go back to Step 1 and regenerate the words by changing the text.

The user should not be able to add more than 15 words to the list. When the user clicks "Create", typically we would send the data to the server but for the purpose of the coding problem, you can print the selected words in the console.
